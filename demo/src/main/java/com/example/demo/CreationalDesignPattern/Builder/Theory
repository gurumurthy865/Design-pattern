1.Builder pattern helps in creation of "Immutable objects" with large set of attributes.
2.Lets say User class has five attributes firstName,lastName,age,phone and address
  If all fields are mandatory then one constructor is enough
  What if age is optional,then either you have another constructor or set age as null
  If we introduce a sixth variable, then no of constructor keep growing which call "Telescoping constructor problem"
  Now wither we create more constructors or lose immutability by introducing setter method.Either way we lose something
  Here BUILDER pattern help us to consume additional attributes of the object retaining immutability.
3.The only DISADVANTAGE is more no of lines in the program
