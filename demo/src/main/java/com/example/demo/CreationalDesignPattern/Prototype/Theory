1.Prototype is preferred when cost of creation of object is large and
  it is easy to copy an existing instance by cloning rather than creating a new instance()
2.Can clone without coupling to the concrete class, getting rid of repeated initialization
2.DISADVANTAGE is that cloning complex object that have circular dependencies


The standard clone method (java.lang.Object.clone()) creates a shallow copy of the object without calling a constructor.
