1.Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.
 Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler
 in the chain.
2.Loose coupling is achieved by passing the request from client through chain of objects to process them.
 ex: try catch block handling different exceptions
