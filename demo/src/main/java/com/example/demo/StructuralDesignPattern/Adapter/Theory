1.Adapter design pattern converts an interface of a class into the interface that clients expects
  ie. Adapter works as an bridge between two incompatible interfaces
2.Binds client to interface and not implementation
3.This pattern is preferred when you need to use an existing class but it's interface does not match the one you need
