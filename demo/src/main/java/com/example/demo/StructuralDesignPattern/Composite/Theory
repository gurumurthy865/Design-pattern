1.Composite design pattern group of objects is treated as same
2.Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and
 then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
 Composes objects into a tree structure with composite and leaf
  Lets say you have a main box and this main box may contain product and more smaller box/boxed
  These smaller box/boxes are considered as composite that may contain more boxes and products
  The products are considered as leaf which represent primitive object in composition
3.Composite pattern suggests that you work with these products and boxes through common interface to find the
  cumulative result.
  ex: Lets say bank has many saving accounts and current accounts and you need to find the total balances of all
      the account
